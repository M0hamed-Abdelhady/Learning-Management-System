The architecture has been evaluated against the following quality attributes:
- Scalability
- Maintainability
- Security
- Performance
- Reliability
- Modifiability

#### 1.3.3 Rationale for Key Decisions
The monolithic architecture was chosen for the following reasons:
1. Simplified development and deployment process
2. Easier debugging and testing
3. Reduced complexity in team coordination
4. Straightforward transaction management
5. Better performance for small to medium-scale applications

## 2. Stakeholders and Concerns

1. System Users
   - Administrators
   - Instructors
   - Students

2. Development Team
   - Software Developers
   - Software Architects

### 2.2 Concerns
#### Purposes of the System-of-Interest
The primary purpose of the Learning Management System (LMS) is to provide a centralized platform for educational institutions to manage courses, students, instructors, and learning materials. It aims to streamline administrative tasks, improve learning outcomes, and offer a scalable, secure, and user-friendly experience for all stakeholders, including students, instructors, and administrators.

#### Suitability of the Architecture
Using a *monolithic* architecture, the system provides the following benefits:

- **Tight integration of features**: All functional modules (e.g., authentication, course management, assessments) are tightly coupled, ensuring seamless communication and consistent performance.

- **Ease of deployment**: The entire system is deployed as a single unit, reducing complexity in the deployment process.

- **Simplified development**: The monolithic design minimizes the overhead of managing inter-service communication, making it suitable for small to medium-sized teams during initial development.
While suitable for the project's scale and initial purpose, potential limitations in scalability and flexibility for future expansions must be addressed.

#### Feasibility of Construction and Deployment
- **Technology stack**: The choice of Java as the primary language ensures high performance, robust security, and extensive community support.

- **Development feasibility**: Java Spring Boot framework simplifies implementing features such as authentication, course management, and notifications.

- **Deployment feasibility**: Deployment in a monolithic architecture is straightforward, requiring only one runtime environment or container, which can simplify DevOps processes.

#### Risks and Impacts
- **Scalability challenges**: A monolithic architecture might face bottlenecks as user demands increase.

- **Single point of failure**: Issues in one module could potentially affect the entire system.

- **Stakeholder impacts**: Stakeholders benefit from rapid development and deployment but may face delays or downtime during system updates, given the monolithic design.

- **Long-term costs**: As the system evolves, maintaining a monolithic codebase might become more challenging, increasing technical debt.

#### Maintenance and Evolution
- **Maintainability**: The use of well-structured code practices, clear module boundaries, and robust testing strategies ensures maintainability. However, significant refactoring might be required for future scalability.

- **Evolution**: The architecture can evolve by:
Refactoring individual modules into services as needed (*eventual migration to microservices*, if required).
Implementing feature toggles to enable iterative deployment of new features.
Enhancing modularization within the monolithic codebase to simplify updates and feature additions.

#### Summary of Concerns
1. **Functional Concerns**
   - User authentication and authorization
   - Profile Management
   - Course management
   - Attendance Management
   - Assessment & Grading management
   - Student Progress Tracking
   - Generating Reports on student performance (Performance Analytics)
   - Media management
   - Notification system

2. **Quality Attribute Concerns**
   - **Security**: Robust authentication and encryption mechanisms protect sensitive data.

   - **Performance**: The system handles concurrent users through optimized database queries and efficient threading.

   - **Reliability**: Data integrity is ensured through ACID-compliant database transactions.

   - **Availability**: Use of robust runtime environments and regular backups to maximize uptime.

   - **Scalability**: Initial focus on horizontal scaling of the monolith; modularization can ease future transitions.

   - **Maintainability**: Clean coding practices, adherence to design patterns, and a clear separation of concerns reduce maintenance overhead.
